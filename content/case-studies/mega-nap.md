description: A full-stack web app that allows front end developers to input data
  and generate RESTful API endpoints for use in their own applications.

Mega Nap is a web application that allows frontend developers to create a database, design database models, populate their new database, and receive RESTful API endpoints they can ping to access their data. All of this is done via a few simple web forms, so they can quickly and easily create and use API endpoints without having to write any backend code.
