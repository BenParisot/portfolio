<p>As a technical project manager turned full stack JavaScript developer, I have a unique understanding of the complexities of a development project and the many and varied ways one can succeed or fail. Different PMs apply different management methods to different projects based on their experience and the needs of the client. Some projects are handled the old fashioned way, following a strict waterfall schedule with deliverable deadlines and features set from the start. Others are more agile, with features being regularly re-prioritized based on user feedback and the clients' changing needs. I've seen projects succeed and fail under a variety of management methods and processes for many different reasons. That's all well and good. <strong><em>HOWEVER...</em></strong></p>
